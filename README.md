A high-level overview of what your Event-Driven E-Commerce Order Processor does:

📦 1. RESTful Order API
Create & list orders via Express endpoints (POST /orders, GET /orders).

Validation (Joi) ensures each order has a valid customerId, an array of items (with sku, quantity, price), etc.

Persistence in MongoDB — orders are stored with status fields (e.g. pending, processed, failed).

🐇 2. Event Publication (RabbitMQ)
As soon as an order is created, the API publishes an order_created message to a RabbitMQ exchange.

This decouples your API from downstream processing: the producer simply fires-and-forgets.

🔄 3. Background Consumer
A separate Node process consumes order_created events.

For each order it:

Updates the order’s status in MongoDB.

Triggers downstream actions (e.g. send a confirmation email via a serverless function).

Emits further events if needed (e.g. order_confirmed, order_failed).

☁️ 4. Serverless Backends
Your email sender and any heavy‐weight post-processing logic are implemented as AWS Lambda functions (via serverless-http), allowing you to scale them independently.

You can plugin additional event handlers (e.g. inventory reservation, shipping label generation) without touching the core API.

🧪 5. Test-Driven Development
Jest & Supertest cover your API endpoints and event handlers.

Tests run against an in-memory MongoDB (mongodb-memory-server), ensuring isolation and fast feedback.

📦 6. Containerization & Distributed Deployment
Docker images for the API and consumer, orchestrated with Docker Compose (MongoDB + RabbitMQ).

Kubernetes manifests (Deployment + Service) let you run each component in its own pod, with ready-made scaling and rolling upgrades.

🚀 7. CI/CD Pipeline
A GitHub Actions workflow lints, tests, builds Docker images, and (optionally) pushes them to your registry.

You can extend it to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster or AWS Lambda via serverless deploy.

📖 8. Documentation
A Swagger / OpenAPI spec documents every endpoint, request/response schema, and authentication requirements.

Consumers and collaborators can generate client SDKs or test calls right from the UI.
